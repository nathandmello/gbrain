/**
 * The `gbrain repair` kind registry: one entry per kind in `REPAIR_KINDS`
 * order (the `--all` dependency order). Everything that lists, previews or
 * runs repairs reads this table — the `gbrain repair` command, the doctor
 * remediation plan and run, and the post-upgrade banner — so a new kind plugs
 * in by adding its name to `REPAIR_KINDS` and one entry here.
 *
 * `checks` names the doctor checks whose findings this kind clears; the
 * remediation run uses it to classify those findings. `embeds` says how a kind
 * can spend on embeddings when a model is configured: `effect` kinds publish a
 * page write whose embedding effect the persistence consumer runs (outside
 * this process, not affected by `--no-embed`); `inline` kinds embed in this
 * process unless `--no-embed` is given.
 *
 * `explicit_only` kinds run only when the operator names them
 * (`gbrain repair <kind>`): `--all`, the remediation plan and run, and the
 * post-upgrade banner list them with their preview command
 * (`explicit_kind_required`) but never run them, and `runRepair` refuses one
 * that was not named, so a supplied remediation step cannot run it either.
